    The boxplots illustrate the spread of the estimated propensity scores in the
treatment and comparison groups. This is a useful way to examine whether or not
the groups have overlap in the propensity score. We note that excellent
covariate balance can often be achieved with propensity score weights, even when
the propensity scores estimated for the treatment and control groups show little
overlap.
