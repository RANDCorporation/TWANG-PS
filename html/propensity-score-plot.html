The boxplots illustrate the spread of the estimated propensity scores in the
treatment and comparison groups. Whereas propensity score stratication requires
considerable overlap in these spreads, excellent covariate balance can often be
achieved with weights, even when the propensity scores estimated for the
treatment and control groups show little overlap.
