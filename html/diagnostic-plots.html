Having fit thepsobject, the analyst should perform several diagnostic checks
before esti-mating the causal effect in question. The first of these diagnostic
checks makes sure that thespecified value ofn.treesallowed GBM to explore
sufficiently complicated models. We can dothis quickly with the
<code>plot()</code> function. As a default, the <code>plot()</code> function
applied to apsobjectgives the balance measures as a function of the number of
iterations in the GBM algorithm, withhigher iterations corresponding to more
complicated fitted models.

If it appears thatadditional iterations would be likely to result in lower
values of the balance statistic,n.treesshould be increased. However, after a
point, additional complexity typically makes the balanceworse, as in the example
below. This figure also gives information on how compatible two ormore stopping
rules are: if the minima for multiple stopping rules under consideration are
nearone another, the results should not be sensitive to which stopping rule one
uses for the finalanalysis.
