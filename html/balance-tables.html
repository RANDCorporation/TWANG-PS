Having estimated the propensity scores, <code>bal.table()</code> produces a
table that shows how well the resulting weights succeed in manipulating the
control group so that its weighted pretreatment characteristics match, or
balance, those of the unweighted treatment group if <code>estimand =
"ATT"</code> or the control and treatment groups so that the weighted
pretreatment characteristics match, or balance, with one another if
<code>estimand = "ATE"</code>. By default, the <code>bal.table()</code> function
uses the value of estimand set with the <code>ps()</code> function call.
