<div style="margin-left:10px; margin-right:10px;"> The effect size plot
illustrates the effect of weights on the magnitude of differences between groups
on each pretreatment covariate. These magnitudes are standardized using the
standardized effect size described earlier. In these plots, substantial
reductions in effect sizes are displayed as blue lines while variables showing
an increase in effect size are displayed as red lines. Closed red circles
indicate a statistically significant difference. In some analyses variables can
have very little variance in the treatment group sample or the entire sample and
group differences can be very large relative to the standard </div>
