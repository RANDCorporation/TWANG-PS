  <h2>Online TWANG Tools for Propensity Score Modeling</h2>
The Toolkit for Weighting and Analysis of Nonequivalent Groups, TWANG, was first developed in 2004 by RAND researchers for the R statistical computing language and environment. The R version of the package contains functions for creating high-quality propensity score weights that can be used to estimate treatment effects with two or more treatment groups and time-varying treatments. 
  <br><br>
This applications is a menu-driven implementation of TWANG and can be used to perform analyses using the TWANG packageâ€™s suite of commands. It supports causal modeling of observational data through the estimation and evaluation of propensity scores and associated weights.
  <br><br>
The foundational method of this app is the propensity score. The propensity score is the probability that an individual or unit would be assigned or exposed to a treatment condition conditional on a set of observed covariates.

  <br><br>
This application aims to (i) compute from the data estimates of the propensity scores weights which yield accurate causal effect estimates, (ii) check the quality of the resulting propensity score weights by assessing whether or not they have good balancing properties, and (iii) use the propensity score weights in computing treatment effect estimates.
