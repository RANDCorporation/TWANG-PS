<h2>TWANG Shiny Tools for Propensity Score Modeling</h2>

The Toolkit for Weighting and Analysis of Nonequivalent Groups, TWANG, was first
developed in 2004 by RAND researchers for the R statistical computing language
and environment. The R version of the package contains functions for creating
high-quality propensity score weights that can be used to estimate treatment
effects with two or more treatment groups and time-varying treatments. Many of these 
functions have been moved into SAS and Stata as well as Shiny apps.

<br><br>

This application is a menu-driven implementation of the TWANG ps() function and 
can be used to perform analyses using the TWANG package’s suite of commands. It 
supports causal modeling of observational data through the estimation and evaluation 
of propensity scores weights (PSW) with two treatment groups.

<br><br>

The foundational method of this app is the propensity score. The propensity
score is the probability that an individual or unit would be assigned or exposed
to a treatment condition conditional on a set of observed covariates. The
ability of the propensity score to serve as a balancing score (Rosenbaum and
Rubin, 1983) implies that, conditional on it, the distribution of the observed
covariates should be the same for the treatment and control groups. Thus, one
can use PSW to “balance” or make the treatment groups under consideration
comparable on the distributions of the observed covariates used in the model of
the PS.

<br><br>

This application aims to (i) compute from the needed PSW, (ii) check the quality
of the resulting PSW by assessing whether or not they have good balancing
properties, and (iii) use the PSW to estimate causal treatment effect estimates
assuming no unobserved confounding or overlap concerns exist in the data.
