    Having fit the <code>ps</code> object, the analyst should perform several
diagnostic checks before estimating the causal effect in question. The first of
these diagnostic checks makes sure that the specified value of
<code>n.trees</code> allowed GBM to explore sufficiently complicated models. We
can do this quickly with the "Convergence" plot. The convergence plot plots the
balance measures (es or ks) as a function of the number of iterations in the GBM
algorithm, with higher iterations corresponding to more complicated fitted
models.

    If it appears that additional iterations would be likely to result in lower
values of the balance statistic, <code>n.trees</code> should be increased.
However, after a point, additional complexity typically makes the balance worse.
This figure also gives information on how compatible two or more stopping rules
are: if the minima for multiple stopping rules under consideration are near one
another, the results should not be sensitive to which stopping rule one uses for
the final analysis.
