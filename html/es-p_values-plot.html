When many of the p-values testing individual covariates for balance are very
small, the groups are clearly imbalanced and inconsistent with what we would
expect had the groups been formed by random assignment. After weighting we would
expect the p-values to be larger if balance had been achieved. We use a QQ plot
comparing the quantiles of the observed p-values to the quantiles of the uniform
distribution (45 degree line) to conduct this check of balance. Ideally, the
p-values from independent tests in which the null hypothesis is true will have a
uniform distribution. Although the ideal is unlikely to hold even if we had
random assignment (Bland, 2013), severe deviation of the p-values below the
diagonal suggests lack of balance and p-values running at or above the diagonal
suggests balance might have been achieved. The p-value plot allows users to
visually to inspect the p-values of the t-tests for group dierences in the
covariate means.
