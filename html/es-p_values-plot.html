    This plot presents the t-test p-value plot for the data and allows users to
visually to inspect the p-values of the t-tests for group differences in the
covariate means. Before weighting p-values are represented using closed circles
and after weighting p-values are represented by open circles. P-values near zero
denote when groups have statistically significant differences on many variables
After weighting we would expect the p-values to be larger if balance had been
achieved and we use a QQ plot comparing the quantiles of the observed p-values
to the quantiles of the uniform distribution (45 degree line) to conduct this
check of balance. Ideally, the p-values from independent tests in which the null
hypothesis is true will have a uniform distribution. Although the ideal is
unlikely to hold even if we had random assignment (Bland, 2013), severe
deviation of the p-values below the diagonal suggests lack of balance and
p-values running at or above the diagonal suggests balance might have been
achieved.
