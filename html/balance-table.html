    The TWANG shiny app generates a series of “Balance Tables” which provides a
tabular summary of the balance between the covariate distributions for the
treatment and control groups before and after propensity score weights and for
each stopping method.  The tables show the following details for each variable
used in the propensity score model: the treatment and control group means and
standard deviations, the standardized difference or effect size [defined as the
treatment group mean minus the control group mean divided by divided by the
pooled sample (treatment and control) standard deviation if <code>estimand =
“ATE”</code> or the treatment group standard deviation if <code>estimand =
“ATT”</code>, as well as the Kolmogrov test statistics and p-value.
